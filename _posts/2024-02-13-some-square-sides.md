Stories of your amazing feats of mathemagical prowess at the mine have reached the king, and he has summoned you to help him with a particularly puzzling problem.

The king presents you with a beautiful music box with some squares around the sides. On each square, there is a dancer and a number indicating the dance move. The king tells you that only a special square dance sequence can open the box. In this dance sequence, each pair of adjacent squares sums to a square number.

Can you help the king open the music box by arranging the squares in the special square dance sequence?

You've opened the music box &mdash; or at least you've made some progress. It seems that the sides of the music box have expanded and more dancers have appeared. Perhaps, if you arrange these dancers in the special square dance sequence, there would be another surprise inside.
