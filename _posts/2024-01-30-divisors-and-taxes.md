You see the first gem in a vending machine and it looks like it only costs **50 coins**!

The coins you need are also just lying in 12 separate piles. The first pile has 1 coins, the second pile has 2 coins, and so on.  You reach out to take the largest pile of 12 coins, but it looks like, even here, [taxes are a certainty](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/benjamin-franklins-last-great-quote-and-the-constitution).

If there are 24 piles of coins, **what is the maximum number of coins you can take?**
