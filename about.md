This is an optional story quest for Mr. Hong's Foundations of Mathematics and Pre-calculus 10 class at Hugh McRoberts Secondary School.
<br><br>
Your goal is to learn the secret to *awesome mathemagical powers* by solving the puzzles in each gem quest to collect the *12 mathemagical gems*.
<br><br>
There is currently no way to save your progress on the website, so make sure to **save your answers**. You will need to use all the gems together to decode the message at the end of the course.
