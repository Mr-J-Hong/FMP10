This is an optional story quest for Mr. Hong's Foundations of Mathematics and Pre-calculus 10 class at Hugh McRoberts Secondary School.
<br><br>
Your goal is to learn the secret to awesome *mathemagical powers* by collecting the 12 *mathemagical gems*. To do so, you will need to solve the puzzles in each chapter.
<br><br>
There is currently no way to save your progress on the website, so make sure to **save your answers**. You will need to use all the gems together to decode the message at the end of the course.
<br><br>
Have fun!
