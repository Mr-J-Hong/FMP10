This is an optional story quest for Mr. Hong's Foundations of Mathematics and Pre-calculus 10 class at [Hugh McRoberts Secondary School](https://mcroberts.sd38.bc.ca/).
<br><br>
Your goal is to learn the secret to awesome mathemagical powers by solving the puzzles in each quest and collecting the 12 *mathemagical gems*. You will need to use all the gems together to decode the message at the end of the course.
