This is an optional story quest for Mr. Hong's math classes at [Hugh McRoberts Secondary School](https://mcroberts.sd38.bc.ca/).
<br><br>
Your goal is to learn the secret to awesome mathemagical powers by solving the puzzles in each quest and collecting the 5 *mathemagical gems*. You will need to use all the gems together to decode the secret message.
