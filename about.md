This is a fun story quest created by Jack Hong to help his students explore some interesting [recreational mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_mathematics) puzzles.
<br><br>
The goal is to learn the secret to awesome mathemagical powers by solving the puzzles in each quest and collecting the 5 *mathemagical gems*. You will need to use all of the gems together to decode the secret message on the home page.
